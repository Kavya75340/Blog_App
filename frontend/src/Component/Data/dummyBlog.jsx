            "In 2020, global technology M&A deals reached $634.1 billion, a 91.8% increase from the previous year, per GlobalData. Despite pandemic-related economic challenges, 2021 saw continued momentum with major tech acquisitions, particularly in silicon innovations and collaboration software. Ericsson acquired Vonage for $6.2 billion to enhance its enterprise communication offerings with cloud contact centers, APIs, and VoIP, complementing its 4G and 5G capabilities. Instacart bought Caper AI for $350 million, leveraging its computer vision technology for smart carts and cashier-less checkouts to bolster its B2B2C retail strategy. Twitter acquired Quill, a Slack competitor, for an undisclosed amount, marking its first purchase post-Jack Dorsey’s exit. Salesforce’s $27.7 billion acquisition of Slack, with its 130,000 paying users, strengthened its collaboration software portfolio. AMD’s $35 billion purchase of Xilinx positioned it as a leader in high-performance computing, rivaling Intel. Microsoft’s $19.7 billion acquisition of Nuance Communications targeted healthcare, integrating AI into its cloud solutions. Citrix acquired Wrike for $2.25 billion to enhance its Workspace platform, while AT&T’s $43 billion WarnerMedia-Discovery merger created a streaming giant to compete with Netflix and Disney+. These deals underscore 2021’s focus on AI, cloud communications, collaboration tools, and semiconductors, driving further industry consolidation and innovation.",

The company also secured a $3.25 million venture debt facility from Silicon Valley Bank, bringing the total funding to $11.75 million. Rainforest provides a payments-as-a-service (PaaS) platform, enabling software companies to embed financial services and payments without the regulatory and compliance burdens of becoming a fintech. Its low-code integration, merchant portability, and white-glove service differentiate it from competitors like Stripe, which primarily focus on direct merchant processing. Rainforest has secured client commitments for over $500 million in processing volume, serving industries like healthcare (PayGround), logistics (RoadSync), and retail (QuoteMachine). The funding will support product development, team expansion, and new payment and lending offerings, as software platforms increasingly shift from legacy processors like Fiserv and FIS.",

            "Pow.Bio, a Berkeley-based startup founded in 2019 by Ouwei Wang and Shannon Hall, raised $9.5 million in a Series A round led by Re:Food and Thia Ventures to address inefficiencies in biomanufacturing. Traditional batch fermentation, where microbes grow, produce, and are harvested in cycles, is slow, costly, and prone to contamination and genetic drift. Pow.Bio’s continuous fermentation platform, supported by AI-controlled software called SOFe, decouples growth and production using a dual-chamber system. One bioreactor optimizes microbial growth, while another focuses on product output, enabling a steady-state process that runs for weeks. This approach increases productivity fivefold, reduces capital expenses, and cuts costs by 30-70% compared to batch methods. The platform, validated at the Advanced Biofuels and Bioproducts Process Development Unit, supports diverse products like organic acids, food proteins, and dairy proteins. Pow.Bio’s $13 million total funding will expand its Alameda, California, demonstration facility, set to open in 2024, scaling production from grams to hundreds of kilograms. The company offers fermentation-as-a-service, licensing, and joint ventures, targeting industries like food, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals to make bio-based products cost-competitive with petrochemical alternatives.",

This recapitalization, supporting $850 million in originations over two years, marks a turnaround after a challenging year involving layoffs and the resignation of co-founder Michele Romanow as CEO.

Having funded over 10,000 companies with more than $2.5 billion, Clearco aims to achieve cash flow break-even within 12 months. The recapitalization addresses a 48% drop in venture capital funding in 2023, providing critical growth capital amid tightened lending conditions for e-commerce startups.",

Its Large Action Model (LAM) observes human interactions via screen recordings to understand and replicate software navigation, handling tasks like booking flights or editing photos without APIs. Unlike robotic process automation, LAM comprehends complex user intentions, supporting apps like Uber, Spotify, and Amazon across platforms. Rabbit’s model is robust to UI changes and plans to expand to Windows, Linux, and niche apps. The company is also building dedicated hardware, the r1 device, launched at CES 2024, to host Rabbit OS. Competitors like Adept’s ACT-1 model pursue similar goals, but Rabbit’s neuro-symbolic approach aims to simplify human-computer interaction, potentially revolutionizing software use by bypassing app-based ecosystems.",

Okta AI leverages multiple models from Google, OpenAI, and Amazon, with potential future use of open-source models, to process identity data and risk signals. Key features include: 1. **Identity Threat Protection**, which uses AI to monitor signals from ecosystems like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, enabling continuous risk assessment and a 'universal logout' to terminate compromised sessions across systems. 2. **Policy Recommender**, trained on data from Okta’s 18,000+ customers, suggests secure application configurations. 3. **Log Investigator**, a generative AI tool, allows natural language queries to analyze logs, set for limited early access in Q3 2024. Okta’s approach integrates predictive and generative AI to enhance threat detection, automate responses, and simplify admin tasks, ensuring robust privacy and compliance. The initiative reflects Okta’s vision to secure human and non-human identities in an AI-driven future, addressing evolving cyber threats.",

The service, supporting Okta Identity Engine, Adaptive MFA, and Workflows, eliminates manual registration, reducing IT costs and enabling rapid phishing-resistant MFA adoption. Yubico plans to expand support to all key models and additional identity providers like Microsoft Entra ID.

Diners sign up for free, tap their phones on NFC readers at restaurants to earn $FLY tokens, which act as loyalty points redeemable for perks like free drinks or exclusive events. Restaurants save 2% on transaction fees compared to traditional processors and gain customer data insights. With 80 restaurants signed up, including 22 active in New York City like Momofuku, Blackbird is expanding to San Francisco and Los Angeles. The funding, bringing total raised to $35 million, will scale operations and launch Blackbird Club, a cross-restaurant points program.
